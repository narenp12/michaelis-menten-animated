# michaelis-menten-animated
Attempt at practicing numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to create a visualization of Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an existing dataset

## Process
1. Create visualization of existing data
2. Fit nonlinear model per M-M derivation
3. Fit more models out of curiousity
4. Create animated plots of data with different models

Part of a series of projects trying to replicate what I can do in R with Python (to refamiliarize myself with it)

## Dataset information
Sourced from R package nlstools: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlstools/nlstools.pdf

Labeled in repository as "vmkmki_mmdata.csv"

### Per them:

vmkmki is a data frame with 3 columns (S: concentration of substrat, I: concentration of inhibitor, v: reaction rate)

#### Source:
These datasets were provided by the French research unit INRA UMR1233.
